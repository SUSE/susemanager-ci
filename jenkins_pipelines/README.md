Each dir is a namespace for pipelines, which are different from topic.

##### Steps to create a pipeline:

0) Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job
1) Configure Jenkins to clone from your custom PR Branch. ( in this way you can tests the pipeline before it get merged in master)  
2) When the PR is merged, update your Job Pipeline to use the **master** branch
3) Create a directory if you are creating pipelines for a special topic. Otherwise add it in the proper namespaces.
